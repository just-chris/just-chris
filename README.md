### Welcome!

👋 So I'm Chris, I come from Poland and I'm a big nerd.

💻 I'm interested in anything computer-related. From electronics, through ASM, c++ and high-level languages to customizing operating systems and building servers.

🎸 I'm also a musican - I play electric guitar since mid 2020 and I'm in love with Alice In Chains.

⏰ I'm very aware of my code so I won't post anything not worth your time here.

💬 You can reach me on discord -> Nathanael#6084. 

🌐 C++ is my second love.

💖 Enjoy!
